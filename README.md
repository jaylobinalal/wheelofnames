# Wheel of Names (riggable clone)

A lightweight clone of wheelofnames.com that lets you double-click a name to highlight it and rig the next spin so it lands on that entry while still animating through a full spin.

## Running locally
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the folder (for example with `python -m http.server`).
2. Edit or paste your list of names in the textarea.
3. Double-click a name (in the textarea or the live list) to highlight it. The next spin will land on that name.
4. Press **Spin** to animate the wheel and reveal the result.
